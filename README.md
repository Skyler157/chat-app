Full Stack Real-time Chat Application with Authentication Using React JS and Firebase

This project is a Full Stack Real-time Chat Application built using React JS for the frontend and Firebase for authentication and real-time data handling. Users can register, log in, and engage in real-time conversations with others. The app leverages Firebase's Authentication service for secure login and registration processes, and Firebase Realtime Database to handle instant messaging. The application supports user-to-user messaging, ensuring that messages are delivered and received in real-time. This project demonstrates how to integrate Firebase with a React-based application to create an interactive, scalable, and efficient chat platform.
